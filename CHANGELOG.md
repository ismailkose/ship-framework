## 2026.03.16 — Initial Release

### Added
- 11 agents: Vi, Arc, Dev, Crit, Pol, Cap, Eye, Test, Bug, Retro, Biz
- 13 slash commands including `/team` orchestrator and `/status`
- `setup.sh` interactive setup (4 questions → full project scaffold)
- Built-in product frameworks: JTBD, HEART, RICE
- Multi-phase workflows for Eye (6 phases), Test (8 phases), Cap (7 phases), Retro (9 steps)
- QA health score system (0-100 with severity-based deductions)
- QA tiers: Quick, Standard, Exhaustive
- Retro data analysis: shipping streak, session detection, time patterns, hotspot analysis, trend comparison
- Optional Playwright browser support for Eye and Cap (real screenshots at desktop + mobile viewports)
- Graceful degradation: screenshot mode when Playwright is installed, code mode when it's not
- Takeover route: Arc → Crit → Vi → Biz → roadmap
- Health check route: Vi → Arc → Crit → Biz → Eye → prioritized roadmap
- Date-based versioning (`YYYY.MM.DD`) with VERSION file
- Version stamped into generated CLAUDE.md footer via setup.sh
- `update.sh` for updating existing projects (updates commands + references + cheatsheet, never touches CLAUDE.md content or TASKS.md)
- `references/animation.md` — animation design principles, audit checklist, and build rules (based on Emil Kowalski's "Animations on the Web")
- Arc defines motion system upfront (easing, timing, springs, reduced motion); Dev, Pol, Eye, Test auto-reference it
- CHEATSHEET.md quick reference card with QA health score reference
- TASKS.md persistent task board with stage-specific starter tasks
- README with detailed agent descriptions, setup + update instructions, browser support docs, file structure for both generated projects and the repo itself
